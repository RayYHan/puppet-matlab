This is puppet-matlab a puppet module for matlab.

Please read the INSTALL file for instructions on getting this installed.
Look in the examples/ folder for usage. If none exist, please contribute one!
This code may be a work in progress. The interfaces may change without notice.
Patches are welcome, but please be patient. They are best received by email.
Please ping me if you have big changes in mind, before you write a giant patch.

Module specific notes:
* Octave is much easier to install, is pretty awesome and free. Try it first.
* I wrote this to help cope with the pain of installing matlab manually.
* Hosting the 4GiB+ .iso files, and sending them through puppet is VERY SLOW.
* You obviously have to provide your own matlab iso. I made mine from the dvd.

Dependencies:
* puppetlabs-stdlib (optional)
* my puppet-puppet module (optional)


Happy hacking,
